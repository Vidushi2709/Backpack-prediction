# Kaggle Playground Series - February 2025: Backpack Price Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the solution for the **Kaggle Playground Series - February 2025** competition, where the objective was to predict backpack prices based on various features. The solution uses **Gradient Boosting Regression** to model the price prediction.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values using imputation.
   - Applied encoding for categorical variables.
   - Normalized numerical features to improve model performance.
   - Removed outliers to prevent model bias.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - Explored the dataset using histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.
   - Visualizations helped identify feature relationships and inform feature engineering.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Used **Gradient Boosting Regression** for price prediction.
   - Tuned hyperparameters like learning rate and estimators for optimal performance.
   - Evaluated the model using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**. (38.91910061143074)

4. **Submission**:
   - The final predictions were made on the test set and submitted to Kaggle.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn


## Results
The model's performance was evaluated using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, with results submitted to Kaggle for evaluation.
